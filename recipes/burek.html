  <p>No Burek no life!</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>

<li>1/2 kg of ready-made crusts for pies and pies</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>1 cup of hot water</li>
<li>150 ml of oil</li>

</ul>
   
<h4>Method</h4>
<ol>
    <li> Turn on the oven at 200 degrees to heat it up.</li>
    <li> Mix hot water and oil. Crumble the cheese.</li>
    <li> Grease a 26cm diameter pan with a little oil.</li>
    <li> Put the crust on the bottom of the pan, so that half of the crust protrudes over the edge. Coat the part of the bark that is at the bottom with a mixture of oil and water, using a brush (mix the mixture before each coating)</li>
    <li> Put another crust over the bottom, but again so that it hangs over the other side of the edge. Coat it too.</li>
    <li> Place the crust again over the second crust, which should be slightly flattened so that it fits in the pan. Spread it, then sprinkle cheese on top.</li>
    <li> Put the pressed crust over the cheese again and spread it and sprinkle with cheese. Repeat the procedure until the last crust.</li>
    <li> Just coat the last crust, align it nicely and tuck it into the edges. Put the part that we left hanging over it, and coat it as well. Coat the other part that we left hanging, coat it again, tuck it nicely and align it.</li>
    <li> Bake in a preheated oven at 200 degrees for 40 minutes. Place the baked burek on a plate or board and cut into quarters.</li>
